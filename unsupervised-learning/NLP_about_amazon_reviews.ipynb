Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\\\\"defeats\\\\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner\t2005-10-14\n"

In other words, I thought the chararacters were interesting to an older teen aged girl, but 12 year olds are not teenagers.  In fact, these characters are 15 and almost 16, all about to be juniors in high school.  And those ages, I think, as a mother, are the appropriate ages for a girl to be reading this book. Not only is there mature sexual content and encounter (albeit, which one of the characters cannot handle), the characters themselves, and their metamorphises, what they go through that summer, what they learn about themselves, will be much more understandable and appropriate to a 14 or 15 or 16 year old, then  to an impressionable 12 or 13 year old.  I would liken it to reading Jane Eyre, or Little Women, before a girl is old enough to understand the levels, the deep meaning,  the beauty of these books.  Sure, girls of 11 and 12 are capable of reading these books, but it is the parents\\' jobs to say \\\\\\\\\"not yet\\\\\\\\\".   I also am disturbed that none of the other reviewers that I read on line seem to understand that one of the characters is self-destructively manic depressive and that would be something ( in fact I would urge any mother who lets her daughter read this book) to discuss the behaviors with her daughter.'"

She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman\\'s long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad\\'s first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD\\'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\\\\\\\\"defeats\\\\\\\\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner',\n",

            "The Outlander series are my favorite books of all time, period.  But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\\\\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.  For all she knows this could be her tenth time doing this.  I haven't seen this matter dealt with in the books.  Did I just miss it or something?\n",
            "Genuinely witty and fun.  I really liked the incorporation of the cartoon and quotations into the book, this made it more interesting and gave a better perspective on the chapters.  An uplifting read from beginning to end.\n",
            "I just want to say, that for a used book, this book arrived in great condition.  I think that it even came in shrink wrap!  I'm pleased with my purchase and am glad that I don't have to read through other people's notes and marks as I study for my class.  Good job!\n",
            "\\\\\"Last Chance to See\\\\\" is Douglas Adams' hilarious and though-provoking non-fiction, eco-travel narrative about circling the globe in search of some of the Earth's most endangered animals. We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\\\\"new\\\\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\\\\"Last Chance to See.\\\\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\\\\"extinct.\\\\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\\\\"last chance to see\\\\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\\\\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\\\\"\n"

            "Isabella Zophie & Le Cirque de Magique is an excellent book. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />\n",
            "I've read almost every book written on the Beatles and found Cynthia's story poignant and from the heart.  She's had a hard time finding her true self in the shadows of her larger-than-life men and marriages and she persists despite the setbacks and enjoys the adventures. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is almost identical to her earlier book, Twist of Lennon in 1989.  I've not read much about her or Julian from 1980 on and it is interesting to look at behind-the-scenes reflections vs. what the public sees.  Julian: Sing again in your own key and forget about Them. <br /> <br />If you are a '42-years And Counting' Beatles fan like me, then  you will enjoy this book.  There are some unreleased pictues you'll relish from Cyn's family album. <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love, oh yeah, yet there wuz a lot of hurtin' souls along Penny Lane besides Eleanor Rigby or Sgt. Pepper. The price of fame which is not fleeting here. <br /> <br />Donna Coulson\n"

We can see that reviews from cluster 0 is all stories, cluster 1 is about \"inform\", so reader might be looking for informations and guidance in books. Cluster 2 is about characters and novels - so reviwers in this category probably reads fictions. Cluster 3 is about time - time travels? cluster 4 is about love, enjoy and great, probably by people who just enjoys reading for the sake of it. We found out different kinds of people give different reviews on books! This is super interesting."

In the future clustering analysis need to think of a better method that is more computationally efficient.\n",
