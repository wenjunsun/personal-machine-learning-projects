# personal-machine-learning-projects

* This is the place that stores my personal works on AI/machine learning projects. 
* You are welcome to look at codes and take inspirations.
* You are also welcome to copy the notebooks to run them on Colab or Databricks, etc.
* However, if you need to distribute my work for educational purposes, please contact me at wenjunsun99@gmail.com
